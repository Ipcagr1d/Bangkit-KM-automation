This is a python code that utilizes Selenium to automatically fill Kampus Merdeka initial assessment. Honestly the code is something I cobbled up together and might not work for your case, but on paper this should work for all path if:
- The students name from the google sheet matched the one from Kampus Merdeka (mine doesnâ€™t match, so I have to manually change the name in google sheet manually)
- The topic name from the google sheet matched the one from Kampus Merdeka

Note: I only verified 25% of the students, but it looks like the result matches with the one from the google sheet.
